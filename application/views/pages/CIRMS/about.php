                        Currently Technical Support Group personnel
                        are manually tracking the history of each computer.
                        When a problem to a specific computer gets reported,
                        the student or professor needs to communicate with someone
                        from Technical Support Group. A log form is then received by
                        the professor who reported the issue and the form gets back
                        to TSG personnel. The report needs to be logged manually thus
                        this may result to loss of files. The report includes the
                        specific issue that the computer has encountered and
                         possible resolution to get it fixed.

                                University. Being one of the developers in this system requires 
                                alot of patience and determination. Creating an Computer 
                                Inventory and Resource Management System (CIRMS) web application 
                                is a bit challenging since we do not have any degree in inventory. 
                                I must say that the success of this project is the group itself.
